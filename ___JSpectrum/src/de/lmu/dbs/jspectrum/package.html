	<b>Java Audio Spectrum Analysis:</b>
	<br><br> 
	Implementations of FFT and Constant Q Transform Algorithms.
	<br><br>
	<b>Also included:</b> 
	<ul>
		<li>Some analyzer tools to run over the spectral data, i.e. a peak detector class and a (very) rudimental 
		    implementation of Anssi Klapuris iterative, polyphonic f0 detection algorithm.</li>
		<li>Some MIDI helper classes to work with the same data types as the spectra generated by the package.</li>
		<li>A Helper class to store the spectral (or any 2-dimensional) arrays to PNG image.</li>
		<li>Usage examples that stores to PNG and/or binary files.</li>
		<li>Utilities to scale the spectral data.</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	The Transforms are all based on the RasmusDSP native Java FFT implementation (CQT also bases on FFT).
	The core CQT is based on an implementation of Karl Helgason and P. J. Leonard, optimized by Thomas Weber.

	<b>Dependencies:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>RasmusDSP audio library (native java FFT implementation)</li>
		<li>JDom 2.0.2 (for XML parsing)</li>
		<li>JOpt Simple 4.4 beta 2 (for command line parsing; in the example only)</li>
	</ul>
