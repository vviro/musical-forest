		### Forest parameters ###
		forestSize:                       Number of trees
		maxDepth:                         Maximum depth of the trees
		percentageOfRandomValuesPerFrame: Percentage of vlaues randomly picked from the test data per frame. Has to be in range [0,1].
		numOfRandomFeatures:              Number of randomly created feature candidates to be evaluated in each node while growing the forest. 
		thresholdCandidatesPerFeature:    Number of thresholds for each generated feature candidate.
		featureFactoryClass:              Class name of the feature to be used.
		entropyThreshold:                 Threshold for information gain of the winner feature in growing a node. If info gain is below 
		                                  or equal entropyThreshold, the node will become a leaf.

	<!--  
		nodedataFilePrefix:        Prefix for the node data files (one will be created for each tree)
		frequencyTableFile:        Path to the frequency table file, usually located beneath the test data folders. The file
		                           holds a table of frequencies corresponding to the bins of the spectral transformation output.

		logNodeInfo:               Show/log more details for each node growed on the console.
		saveGainThresholdDiagrams: Save a gains/thresholds diagram in a png file for each nodeÂ´s winner feature, 
		                           up to the given depth. 
		saveNodeClassifications:   Save classifications for each node after test classification run, up to the 
		                           given depth.
